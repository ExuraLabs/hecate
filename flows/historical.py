    Fast initialization for Block objects that bypasses Pydantic validation.

    This optimized initialization directly assigns attributes from kwargs
    without constructing or validating Pydantic models. It's designed for
    processing historical blocks where validation is redundant.

    Note:
        This method omits all validation checks present in the original
        implementation. Type mismatches or missing fields won't raise
        errors, which is acceptable for historical data but potentially
        dangerous for real-time blocks.

        When processing hundreds of thousands of blocks, this can significantly
        reduce CPU without affecting correctness.
